# Installing the dependencies

In the projects root directory

```
npm install

```

This will install all the dependencies in the package.json

Then:

> Go into the src directory and run the start script

```
cd ./src

npm start

```
You can start your browser with that command to disable CORS. Because you are sending localhost api request with this application.
```
chromium-browser --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="/home/[YOUR-USERNAME]/test"
```

This will run the start script in the package.json (this runs webpack --watch which will automatically recompile index.ts in the src directory on every change)

In the public folder/directory

open index.html (if you are using visual studio code as your text editor use liveserver extension)

<p>
<span style="font-size: 1.3rem"> 
If all the steps are done correctly the counter-example  show be rendered  in your browser when you open index.html in your browser with liveserver
</span> <br/>
